    def _create_base64_image(self) -> str:
        """
        Converts a numpy array representing an image into a base64-encoded JPEG string.

        This method is used to transform raw image data, stored as a numpy array.
        The image data is first converted into a PIL Image object,
        then encoded into JPEG format, and finally converted into a base64 string
        for transmission.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image_array : numpy.ndarray
            The image data as a numpy array.

        Returns
        -------
        str
            The base64-encoded string representation of the JPEG image. This string
            can be used in the JSON message, which requires text-based image encoding.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the input image_array is not in a valid format that can be converted
            into a JPEG image.

        Notes
        -----
        - If the provided image array is `None`, then there was an error with the camera during the
        image capture process. Since the connection to the MQTT broker is not established yet,
        the image capturing function will provide `None` as the return value.
        This way we can log the error through MQTT when it connects.
